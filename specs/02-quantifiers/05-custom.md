# Custom

To set custom min and max values of quantifier there exists `{#,#}` syntax;

- `{2,4}` means `{ "min": 2, "max": 4 }`
- `{,4}` means `{ "max": 4 }`
- `{2,}` means `{ "min": 4 }`
- `{3}` or `{3,3}` means `{ "min": 3, "max": 3 }`

Both min and max values are inclusive. Other quantifiers can be expressed with
this syntax as well;

- Default is `{1}`
- `?` is `{0,1}`
- `+` is `{1,}`
- `*` is `{0,}`

For example;

`CONCEPTS: service.concepts.json`

```json name="service.concepts.json"
{
    "$service{1,3}": {
        "$parameter{,2}": "$type",
        "response{1}": {
            "$status{2,}": "$responseType"
        }
    }
}
```

This concepts definition should have following shadow;

`CONCEPTS SHADOW`

```json name="service.concepts-shadow.json"
{
    "concept": {
        "name": "service",
        "quantifier": { "min": 1, "max": 3 },
        "literal": {
            "name": "response",
            "quantifier": { "min": 1, "max": 1 },
            "concept": {
                "name": "status",
                "quantifier": { "min": 2 },
                "variable": {
                    "name": "responseType"
                }
            }
        },
        "concept": {
            "name": "parameter",
            "quantifier": { "max": 2 },
            "variable": {
                "name": "type"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

It is trivial to give schema validation examples here. Basically, any concept or
literal should not have less occurrences than their minimum quantifiers, and
they should not have more occurrences than their maximum quantifiers.

> Since literals can occur at most once, they can only have four valid custom
> quantifiers `{,1}`, `{0,1}`, `{1}`, `{1,1}`. All of these can be represented
> with default or `?` quantifier. So it is trivial, but still supported for the
> sake of consistency.
